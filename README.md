Exploratory Data Analysis
=========================

This is my repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis". Currently there are 9 files for the Course Project 1: 4 png pictures and 5 scripts to generate all plots.

To run this script you need to do the following:
* Download the scripts (load_data.R, plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to some directory;Make that as working directory using setwd()
* Download the data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;
* Extract the data into ./data subdirectory;
* Run the scripts
